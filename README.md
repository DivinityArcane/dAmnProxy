dAmnProxy
=========

A simple proxy made for being the middle-man between a bot/client and dAmn, but it can serve to any host/port.

Note: It is not intended to be complicated and do things like log clients or statistics. All it does is creates a proxy between two hosts (and optionally outputs all packets sent between them.)
